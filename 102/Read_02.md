# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.

Go through these resources, and  **create a page in your reading-notes repo**  that summarizes what you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Reading-notes entry ideas:

-   Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
-   Dictionary / Flash Cards
-   Notes in outline form
-   Comparison of “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

## Read

-   [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

## Read Carefully

The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal. While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL). Read through these pages carefully.  **_Don’t worry about trying this out on your own system yet, that will come very soon._**  For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.

-   [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)
-   [About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

## Answer

1.  What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
2.  What do the following commands do?
    1.  `pwd` - print working directory
    2.  `ls` - list
    3.  `cd` - change directory
    4.  `mkdir` - make directory
    5.  `touch` - creates a file
3.  Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
    1.  `cd projects` - change directory to /projects
    2.  `mkdir new-project` - make directory new-project
    3.  `touch new-project/newfile.md` - create a new file named newfile.md in the new-project
    4.  `cd ..` - change directory to the parent directory
    5.  `ls projects/new-project` - change directory to the parent directory

## Submission Instructions

-   Share what you’ve learned by  **copying and pasting the full text of your new rendered web page**  into the ‘Reply’ below.
-   Include the live URL of the new page below your pasted text. (_Hint: The URL of the page should begin with YOUR GitHub username, not “github.com”_)

You are invited to check out your classmates’ replies and give positive feedback and words of encouragement.
